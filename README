tinyacme
========

This is a trivial Go wrapper around the net/http and x/crypto/acme packages,
primarily intended for provisioning TLS certificates for non-web services.

Given a list of hostnames as command-line arguments, it resolves them to a
complete set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, binds to every address on the https
port tcp/443, then obtains TLS certificates from an ACME-based provider by
responding to TLS-ALPN-01 challenges.

The ACME endpoint can be specified using the ACMEURL environment variable.
If this is unset, the Let's Encrypt ACME v2 service is used by default:

  https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

If any of the addresses is in use or not local, tinyacme will die with an
error before any certificates are ordered. Otherwise, for each hostname, a
combined PEM-format key and certificate file is written in the current
directory, with mode 0600 and filename matching the hostname.

On subsequent invocations, tinyacme will first validate existing certificate
files and only renew them if they are invalid or within 30 days of expiry.


Building and installing
-----------------------

To build tinyacme, run 'go build' in the source tree. To install it, copy
the binary into a directory on your path. It should compile and run on any
platform with Go 1.17 or later.
